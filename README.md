# The Greedy Gold Digger

This code is an implementation of a trading algorithm based on trends in the gold market. The algorithm uses a lot multiplication strategy to recover losses and is optimized for trading the XAUUSD (Gold) symbol. It is a plug-and-play model with minimal setup required.

## Technical Specification

1. Trading algorithm based on trend in the gold market
2. Lot multiplication strategy to recover losses
3. Optimized for XAUUSD (Gold) symbol
4. Plug-and-play model with minimal setup
5. Recommended setup and parameters provided
6. Demo account testing before live trading
7. Essential trading functions included in the code

## Dependencies

This code requires the following libraries:
- Trade.mqh
- MovingAverages.mqh

## Constants

The following constants are defined:
- SYMBOL_NAME: Specifies the trading symbol (XAUUSD)
- TRADE_VOLUME: Specifies the trade volume (0.01)
- STOP_LOSS: Specifies the stop loss level (100)
- TAKE_PROFIT: Specifies the take profit level (200)

## Global Variables

The code initializes the following global variables:
- trade: An instance of the CTrade class for executing trades
- ma: An instance of the CMovingAverages class for calculating moving averages

## Expert Initialization

The OnInit() function is called during expert initialization. It sets the expert magic number and deviation in points.

## Expert Deinitialization

The OnDeinit() function is called during expert deinitialization. It performs any necessary cleanup tasks.

## Expert Tick Function

The OnTick() function is called on each tick. It calculates the moving average value and the current price. If there is an existing open position, it checks if the price has crossed below the moving average and closes the position. If there is no open position, it checks if the price has crossed above the moving average and opens a new buy position.

## Program Entry Point

The OnStart() function is the program entry point. It starts the trading algorithm by calling the OnTick() function. It then waits for user input to end the program.
